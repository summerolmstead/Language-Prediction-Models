In this first assignment for Introduction to Machine Learning, we create three different models to see which has the highest accuracy for predicting
what language it is given a text output. The languages we train and test the model on a 80/20 spilt are French, English, and German. 
The models we create are KNN, SVM, and MLP to see which has the highest accuracy on predicting what language the model is being given when prompted.
